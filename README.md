# Tensura: Reincarnated - Addon Example

## About
The following repository was created to assist in the creation of addons for Tensura: Reincarnated, a Minececraft Forge mod. 

This not only serves as an easily downloadable template to speed up the gradle setup, but also has examples of adding the following:

* Common Skills
* Intrinsic Skills
* Extra Skills
* Unique Skills
* Ultimate Skills
* Races [Todo]
* Gamerules [Todo]
* Config Files [Todo]


## Installation [Todo - Add more detail]
This project should be easy to install and set up. All gradle configuration has been done, so simply open the project in Intellij, and build it.

To get started, you will need to modify the gradle.properties to change the mod_id and mod_name.

Then, update the project structure to your unique namespace, as well as renaming files away from the default "Example" and "tenaddex"

More detailed explanations coming soon.
